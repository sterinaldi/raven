# RaVeN
Non-parametric inference of the radial velocity distribution of stars in globular clusters.

RaVeN relies on [FIGARO](https://github.com/sterinaldi/FIGARO) for the non-parametric inference, so please be sure that you have it installed and properly working (pip installation is sometimes faulty...).
